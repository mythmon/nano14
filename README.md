A few notes
-----------

You may notice that I includes breaks in my writing that follow a 

    @ Something is said

    & Something else is said

    @ A dialog may ensue

This is a sort-of style I have taken up in which I write down any internal
dialogues about my writing to get them out of my head. If you feel they
are frustrating or get in the way of your reading experience feel free to
cut them out. I will eventually make a branch which contains no & @ dialogues.

&@ dialogues are not counted in my final WC for NaNoWriMo.

If you are viewing this on nano.elijahcaine.me thank you for visiting and
enjoy reading the things I have written. For more info on me visit
elijahcaine.me which is currently my blog.

Please don't steal my writing. If you have to give me proper credit and don't
monetize. Thanks.

Thanks.
