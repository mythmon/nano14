&& So I just scanned through my old notes, I have a lot of random creative
&& ideas. I think I found one to launch this chapter off.

@@ Umm... great. I'm not sure what to do if I don't harp and critique for a few
@@ hundred words before the actual work starts.

&& Sounds like a personal problem

Two men, one tall and one quite a bit shorter sit on a curb just outside of
coffeebucks. The tall man has ordered an obscenely large coffee. Neither party
seem to take note of this, as if it is a regular occurrence. It is dark now
at 17:30 and they are both sick of this being the only conversation anybody is
able to muster up for the unavoidable 'Small Talk'. 

They both sit on the curb for almost thirty seconds without exchanging any
words.

"So what's your opinion on addiction?"

"Hmm? In what regard?"

"How do you feel about addiction. The idea, the concept, those afflicted with
some form or another of it, etc."

"Oh, I can't stand it. Addiction is the worst thing one can inflict upon
themselves." He says as he sips his espresso.

"Upon oneself?"

"Yeah, you had to make the choice at some point to take an addictive substance,
right? You don't just accidentally shoot up on heroin a few times. You have to
*choose* to get addicted to something."

"One has to choose?"

"Of course. I'm not trying to just sit around jerking myself off or anything
but I'm a firm believer that if you were able to get addicted in the first
place you can kick the habit. Everybody that says otherwise is just a huge
pussy."

"A huge pussy?"

"The biggest pussy there is."

"The biggest?"

The tall man pauses and glares at the smaller man.

"You're doing that thing again?"

"That thing again?"

"The thing where you repeat the last thing I said so I keep talking and 
divulging how I feel."

"How you feel?"

"Shut up. I've got somewhere better to be."

The tall man took a sip of his NeoGrandeXX and began collecting his belongings:
phone, wallet, keys, all of which he had placed on the table because they made
his pinched his thighs.

"You and I both know that's not true. Now tell me why you feel like you're a
pussy."

"I didn't say that!"

"How much was that coffee."

"About five dollars."

"And you how many do you drink in a day?"

"At least eight."

"Jesus. That's 40$ a day. Do you feel that coffee is interfering with your 
ability to socialize with your friends and family."

"I don't th--"

"Before you answer I would like to point out that you ditched your niece's 
birthday party to get this coffee with me."

"Whatever man you were bored as shit. I did this for you as much as it was for
me. She's turning 26 for fucks sake. Nobody that's turning 26 needs a birthday
party."

"Did you really leave the party for me? I think it's time to admit you have a 
problem sweetie. You are addicted to coffee."

"Fuck off man."

"I love you too."

Then the man who was about as short as the tall man was tall then took a flask 
out of his back pocket and took a swig. He then took a metallic cigarette 
container out from his left shirt pocket, placed a cigarette in his mouth, and
with his last match lit the end of it. He took a long drag, held it in his
lungs for 16 seconds, and released the contents of his lungs into the face of
the tall man who didn't bat an eye as he blankly stared into the distance.

The smaller man then asked "Want to head out?"

"Sure."

They both stood up. It is now even more apparent the height difference. The
smaller man throws his cigarette on the sidewalk, stomps on it with his left
foot, and puts away his flask.

"When did you start to smoke?"

The shorter man shrugged. They walked down the street and turn the corner
back to the taller man's niece's birthday party. Eventually the taller man
takes the smaller man's hand and they walk like this for a while, until the
shorter man's palms get sweaty and then they just walk side by side.

@@ You've been thinking a lot about Infinite Jest.

&& I mean... yeah. But also I've been thinking about the topic of addiction and
&& perspective.

@@ OMG pop` are you addicted to something! It's Molly isn't it.

&& I'm not even sure what Molly... does.

@@ It's a fine chapter. I think it's good you wrote it out finally, you've had
@@ that idea on the back-burner for a while.

&& Yeah. At this point though I'm not sure which direction to take it in. I
&& could go to the niece's birthday party, but I kinda want to rewrite the
&& whole thing.

@@ You shouldn't do that.

&& I know, but it wasn't funny when it was supposed to be and now it exists but
&& I'm totally not happy with what I've made but I'm not sure how I'll ever be
&& happy with this because it's got so much potential to do so many things and
&& tell so many stories around a central theme.

@@ Yo. Calm your tits.

&& I know I know.

@@ Oh man is his niece the girl in chapter two?

&& I can neither confirm nor deny that. Because I haven't written it yet. :P

@@ DAMN YOU ORGANIC STORY TELLING!

&& It just... it didn't capture the feeling the inital idea was mean't to
&& capture. It was supposed to be a short 'how do you feel about addiction'
&& `can't stand it`, *takes sip of coffee* 'riiight'.

@@ But you wanted to write 1000 words today...

&& Sure but I could have written 1000 words some other way.

@@ The commit log for this chapter says otherwise.
