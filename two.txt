@@ Great. Now what do you want to write.

&&  I guess we should flesh out this character a bit more. Oh what if I wrote
&&  everything that's deep and personal from his point of view and all the 
&&  public stuff from other people's perspective.

@@ Will that work?

&&  I don't see why not. It very well could work. I don't know if it should be
&&  third person or just from other people's perspective.

@@ The advantage of course of going from somebody else's perspective is that 
@@ you can insert opinions (your own and those of characters). You wouldn't get
@@ that with third person, or at least not in the same way I'm imagining it.

&&  I don't have a secondary character in mind.

@@ Then roll with third person.

...

&&  Oh shit this means I need to decide on a name.

@@ Foo?

&&  That would make it easy to %s/find/replace/g later on...

@@ Roll with that. In the mean time try doing secondary character perspective.

&& Ya think?

@@ Yeah, it'll force you to flesh out the story and introduce new, complex 
@@ characters. You can't write 50k words, or even 20k without some other shit 
@@ going on besides some self-centered douche going through depression.

&& I could just banter like this for 4.5k words.

@@ Or you could write.

Oh my glob. This is how I die. I'm going to bleed out all over the floor, my
brains will spill out of my ears, and I'll just writhe around in the middle of
the room until somebody calls the janitors to clean me up because at that point
I'll just be a puddle. I'm basically thirty seconds from being a puddle. 
Basically. 

"There are 20 minutes left. The test is half over now. You should be around 
question five or six."

Question five?? I'm on question two! This isn't real. This can't be happening.

This is so dumb. I can't fucking believe I didn't study this material enough.
He talked about it for literally the first three weeks of class. That's
basically all we covered for those first three weeks. I remember I almost 
dropped the class because it seemed like he might never stop covering that 
material. I get that it's important and pivotal to the rest of the class but 
really? Three weeks is just insane... 

Did he put up a study plan? I don't remember seeing a study plan on his
website. Maybe there was and I just didn't give a hoot. This class was supposed
to be easy. **EVERYBODY SAID IT WOULD BE EASY**. **WHY ISN'T THIS EASIER!**

Maybe I can spin some excuse while I turn it in and he'll grade me a little
easier like... I could say my hamster died last night. I mean... it's a lie,
but who's counting? I'm not. I mean, I am counting, I'm just counting the
seconds until I die of embarrassment because I wasn't prepared at all for this 
test.

"Five minutes remaining in the test. Try to wrap it up."

What??? How the frack did that happen? I haven't done anything in the last
twenty minutes? Flunk I'm hopeless. I need to work. I need to finish this
faster. I'll just skim each question and scribble the first thing that comes
to my mind...

"Turn your tests in. Time's up."

Oh. My. Gosh. I'm doomed.

"Congratulations! You have all survived the first half of Disney: An Analysis
of an Empire. I'll see you all next week. Don't forget we won't be meeting up
on Monday because of the test schedule thing."

I just... I can't even believe I bombed this class. I should give up now and
move to Alaska. Maybe I'll marry a bear. Or a Moose. Or both? What's Alaska's
policy on polygamy+bestiality. Do those illegal activities stack linearly or
exponentially.

I might as well turn in the test. I'm not sure what the point is anymore, I'm
basically a waste of human resources anyway. I don't deserve to be at this
University, or this State, or this Country, or this planet really.

"You looked like you were having a hard time. Are you okay?"

"What? Oh... I guess just didn't feel... super prepared for the test I guess."

"Nah, I bet you did great. You're too hard on yourself."

"I... I guess so."

I didn't know what else to say so I rushed out the door. $BAR was waiting
for me down the hall.

"How do you think you did?"

"I don't know. I think I missed at least half the fracking questions."

"Really? Did you at least put something down for all of them?"

"I mean, technically. I scribbled something down but it's not like any of it
made sense. How did you do?"

"I felt pretty good. Didn't feel super confident about the last Cinderella
question, but everything else felt solid."

"Great. I'm glad to hear it." 

There isn't enough peanut butter for how jelly I am of $BAR. She has it so
easy. She doesn't seem to study at all and everything is easy. I wish I could
pull that off. I don't have enough time to be as bad at stuff as I am.

@@ That seems like a weird place to end the chapter

&& I'm not sure what to add. It's not like... wrapped up but it's not like we
&& aren't going to see this character ever again.

@@ Do you promise?

&& :P
