&& Oh shit I have no idea what to write...

@@ Then write the first thing that comes to your head

&& But *this* is the first thing that comes to my head

@@ That's really dumb dude.

&& Fuck off.

@@ You fuck off. *You* said you wanted to NaNoWriMo. *You* said it would be
@@ fun to write a story. *You* don't get to complain when you don't actually
@@ have anything to write about.

&& Fine.

...

&& But I still don't have any ideas.

@@ Cool story bro. Tell me more.

&& Okay, I've got a starting point

@@ Just a starting point?

&& Go fuck yourself dude. It's better than nothing.

@@ :) Let's hear it

I had a long day. A really really long day. The kind of day that never feels
like it'll ever finish; one that's so long that when you're at the end you can
barely remember the beginning. It's days like this that make going on a run
so goddamn hard.

I look outside.

"I know it wouldn't be light outside if this were summer, but for fucks sake,
I'm pretty sure winter's dark is darker than the Summer's dark."

I just got home and already I'm stripping down to my bare ass to put on some
short shorts and a neon reflective jacket. I slip on my left jogging my shoe 
which I haven't had to tie since the day I got bought the pair. You've got to
appreciate the small things or you'll never make it. Ya know?

"I wish exercising didn't make me feel so good. I fucking hate that."

My outfit is well loved, or at least that's what I used to say to my ex to get
her to stop bothering me about how gross it all is. You know it's bad if you 
can smell the clothes and *you* think they smell bad. Usually you can ride that
weird "Oh, that's just me smell, that doesn't smell *too* bad." feeling. These 
clothes though, they are just rank. I've even washed them, but the stank won't
quit. That's love ya know, a stank that just won't quit.

I fiddle with my right shoe until it slips on satisfyingly.

Great. Let's go get some exercise.

I used to listen to music as I ran, or audio books if I wanted to feel
productive. Eventually I realized I just needed to take a real breather. Not
just a run, but a full life detox. It's boring as shit sure, but at least I
don't end the run more wound up than when I started.

I expected that eventually I'd feel less bored, but I really don't. I kinda...
check out I guess. I don't stop being bored I just stop being... me entirely.
I would go as far as to say I stop *being* but that's waaayyy too pretentious,
even for an internal monologue.

left.right.left.right.left.right.left.right.left.right.left.right.

I also stopped keeping track of how far I ran a few weeks ago. I hate to say
it but I really don't have any other way to put it: I'm getting to be pretty
fucking Zen about this whole running thing. I don't care about how far I go
or where I end up or how long it takes... I just go.

left.right.left.right.left.right.left.right.left.right.

I just keep going. I don't stop until I can't go further, then I turn back and
I go some more. I'm probably running like 10 miles a night. But who's counting.

left.right.left.right.left.right.left.right.

I get a lot done. Sure I'm a wreck in the morning but who gives a fuck. I sure
as fuck don't.

left.right.left.right.left.right.

At a certain point I feel like I can't stop.

left.right.left.right.

I need to go forward. Into the darkness.

Until it surrounds me.

@@ So that was  a metaphor for depression?

&& Basically. Kinda heavy handed.

@@ Meh, it's nono, nobody's expecting a masterpiece. Heck, nobody's expecting
@@ anything at all.

&& Thanks. :)

@@ No problem :P
